# Decision Optimization for DSX Local Workshop (DODS)
Lab instructions and assets for the 2018 Fast Start Decision Optimization Lab.

>Please use the same DSX Local cluster assigned to you for the DSX Local labs.

In this workshop you will learn how to use the  CPLEX Python API to develop Decision Optimization notebooks, load data and create scenarios utilizing the new Decision Optimization for Data Science Add-on. There are 3 labs:
1. Utilizing the DOCplex Python API from Notebooks
2. Creating an Optimization Model & Planning scenarios with DODS
3. Preview Execution Service (coming soon)


## About this repository
This repository contains several lab subfolders. Some labs include notebooks and data, while others have additional instructions.

## Prerequisites
1. Knowledge of analytics. These labs do not teach you the basics of analytics or how to implement analytics in R, Python and SPSS. The purpose of this workshop is to provide hands-on experience with DODS. 
2. To run this workshop you need an instance of DSX Local. **Please note that while most code is the same between DSX Local and DSX Cloud, the notebooks included in sample projects will work in DSX Local only**
3. Download and unzip this [this repository](https://codeload.github.com/elenalowery/DSX_Local_Workshop/zip/master). Unzip the repository only, not files in subfolders. 

### Setting up lab projects in DSX Local
1. Rename **DSX_Local_Workshop.zip** located in **DSX_Local_Projects** folder of the unzipped repository to a unique name, for example, add your initials.    *Note: Project names in DSX Local cluster must be unique. When we create a project "from file", the project name is inherited from the file name*. 
2. Log in to DSX Local.
3. Select "Create New Project" and select "From File".
4. Browse to the .zip file and click **Create**.
